# Diet Plan Based on an Individual Prakruti

**Personalized diet plan** based on their **prakruti** (body constitution) derived from Ayurvedic principles. A chatbot is integrated to help individuals determine their prakruti by answering a series of questions about their physical traits, emotional tendencies, and dietary habits. After the prakruti is identified, a specific diet plan is recommended according to their dominant dosha (Vata, Pitta, or Kapha).

- **Backend**: The backend, built in Python or JavaScript, processes user inputs using an AI-powered decision-making algorithm to classify the dominant dosha. This results in the creation of a personalized diet plan.
- **AI Chatbot Integration**: The chatbot is implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries.
- **Diet Recommendations**: The system generates diet plans and health recommendations based on the user's dosha.

## How It Works

1. **Chatbot Interaction**: 
   - The chatbot begins by asking users a series of questions regarding their physical characteristics (e.g., body type, skin texture, weight) and emotional tendencies (e.g., mood swings, stress responses).
   - Users answer these questions through a conversational interface.

2. **Prakruti Analysis**: 
   - Based on the responses, the chatbot evaluates which dosha (Vata, Pitta, or Kapha) is dominant in the individual.
   - A scoring mechanism is used to weigh the attributes based on Ayurvedic principles.

3. **Personalized Diet Plan**:
   - After determining the dominant dosha, the chatbot provides a **personalized diet plan** that includes:
     - **Foods to include**: Foods that align with the dominant dosha’s characteristics.
     - **Foods to avoid**: Foods that could disrupt the balance of the dosha.
     - **Health Tips**: Lifestyle recommendations such as exercise and sleep patterns for optimal well-being.
